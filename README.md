# Locus

Locus is a web application  designed to encourage high school and college students to participate in science and to teach each other . It will help students understand and enjoy science by collaborating on simple experiments with students from different parts of the globe. The application includes a form for the students to post their observations in the form of document links, data files or even pictures. This data is stored in a MySQL database and displayed on the landing page for the user. The students will also be able to view data entered by other students and post comments.
